Softkey Signature Provider is an example pluggable signature provider for [EOSIO SDK for Java](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java). It allows for signing transactions using in-memory SECP256K1 and SECP256R1 keys.

**Important:** Softkey Signature Provider stores keys in memory and is therefore not secure. It should only be used for development purposes. In production, we strongly recommend using a signature provider that interfaces with a KeyStore, authenticator or wallet.

## Updates
- Version 1.0.0.  This version consumes the new eosio-java library version 1.0.0.
- Version 0.1.3.  The version consumes the new eosio-java library version 0.1.2.
- Version 0.1.2.  The version includes updates on Mockito and Powermock dependencies to prevent the build error "Failed to transform...using Jetifier." that is occurring with new versions of AndroidX.

# About Signature Providers

The Signature Provider abstraction is arguably the most useful of all of the [EOSIO SDK for Java](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java) providers. It is responsible for:

* finding out what keys are available for signing (`getAvailableKeys`), and
* requesting and obtaining transaction signatures with a subset of the available keys (`signTransaction`).

By simply switching out the signature provider on a transaction, signature requests can be routed any number of ways. Need a signature from keys in the platform's Keychain or KeyStore? Configure the [TransactionSession](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/session/TransactionSession.java) with a conforming signature provider that exposes that functionality. Need signatures from a wallet on the user's device? A signature provider can do that too!

All signature providers must conform to the [ISignatureProvider](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/interfaces/ISignatureProvider.java) Protocol.

### Prerequisites

* Java JDK 1.8+ (1.7 source compatibility is targeted)
* Gradle 4.10.1+

Since EOSIO SDK for Java: Softkey Signature Provider is not an Android specific project, we recommend using IntelliJ if you are going to work on it.  You can use Android Studio but be aware that some of the menu options under Build like `Rebuild Project` and `Clean Project` will not work correctly.  You may still compile within Android Studio using `Make Project` under the Build menu, or by using Gradle from the command line.

## Installation

This provider is intended to be used in conjunction with [EOSIO SDK for Java](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java) as a provider plugin.

To use Softkey Signature Provider with EOSIO SDK for Java in your app, add the following modules to your `build.gradle`:

```java
implementation 'one.block:eosiojava:1.0.0'
implementation 'one.block:eosiojavasoftkeysignatureprovider:1.0.0'
```

If you are using Softkey Signature Provider, or any library that depends on it, in an Android application you must also add the following to your application's `build.gradle` file in the `android` section:

```groovy
// Needed to get bitcoin-j to produce a valid apk for android.
packagingOptions {
    exclude 'lib/x86_64/darwin/libscrypt.dylib'
    exclude 'lib/x86_64/freebsd/libscrypt.so'
    exclude 'lib/x86_64/linux/libscrypt.so'
}
```
The `build.gradle` files for the project currently include configurations for publishing the project to Artifactory.  These should be removed if you are not planning to use Artifactory or you will encounter build errors.  To do so, make the changes marked by comments throughout the files.

Then refresh your gradle project. Then you're all set for the [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) example!

## Basic Usage

Generally, signature providers are called by the [TransactionProcessor](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/session/TransactionProcessor.java) during signing. (See an [example here](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java#basic-usage).) If you find, however, that you need to get available keys or request signing directly, this library can be invoked as follows:

```java
SoftKeySignatureProviderImpl provider = new SoftKeySignatureProviderImpl();
try {
    List<String> availableKeys = provider.getAvailableKeys();
} catch (GetAvailableKeysError getAvailableKeysError) {
    getAvailableKeysError.printStackTrace();
}
```

And to import a private key:

```java
try {
  provider.importKey("Your eos format private key in SECP256K1 or SECP256R1 type");
} catch (ImportKeyError importKeyError) {
  importKeyError.printStackTrace();
}
```

To sign an `EosioTransactionSignatureRequest`, you should first create it with your serialized transaction and list of public keys. EOSIO SDK for Java handles the creation of the object for you.

Finally, call `signTransaction` to sign.

```java
try {
  String serializedTransaction = "Your serialized transaction";
  List<String> publicKeys = Arrays.asList("Your eos format public key in SECP256K1 or SECP256R1 type");
  EosioTransactionSignatureRequest request = new EosioTransactionSignatureRequest(serializedTransaction, publicKeys, chainId, null, false);
  EosioTransactionSignatureResponse response = provider.signTransaction(request);
} catch (SignTransactionError signTransactionError) {
  signTransactionError.printStackTrace();
}
```

## Android Example App

If you'd like to see EOSIO SDK for Java: Softkey Signature Provider in action, check out our open source [Android Example App](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-android-example-app)--a working application that fetches an account's token balance and pushes a transfer action.

## Library Methods

This library is an example implementation of [ISignatureProvider](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/interfaces/ISignatureProvider.java). It implements the following protocol methods:

* `signTransaction(EosioTransactionSignatureRequest eosioTransactionSignatureRequest)` signs a `Transaction`
* `getAvailableKeys()` returns an array containing the public keys associated with the private keys that the object is initialized with

Import a key by calling:

* `importKey(String privateKey)`
